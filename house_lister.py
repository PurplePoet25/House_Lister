# Program: Assignment-6 (bring up in IDLE)
#
# Programmer: Hasan Bukhari
#
# Date: 11/13/2024
#
# Description: The program displays a menu of options, allowing the user to select an action by entering a number between 1 and 6. It ensures 
#              that the input number is valid and, based on the selection, either lists all house records, displays the total inventory, prompts 
#              the user to add a new house, deletes a house by ID, finds a house by its ID, or edits the information of an existing house. 
#              If the user selects "Add a House," the program asks for the houseâ€™s unique ID, address, cost, square footage, and year built. 
#              Each new house is stored as a list within a list that holds all records. The program also reads existing house data from a 
#              file/database called `house.txt` and processes it accordingly. If the user chooses "Delete," "Find," or "Edit," the program 
#              searches for a matching house ID and either removes, displays, or edits the corresponding house details. After any changes, 
#              the program writes the updated data into a new file/database called `newhouse.txt`. This process repeats until the user selects "6" 
#              to exit, terminating the program.
#
# Requirements: Python 3.9 or greater
#
# Variable Library:
#   houses          - stores list of lists; each inner list contains details for a single house [ID, address, cost, square footage, year built]
#   house           - stores individual house details as a list, used when iterating over houses or adding a new house [ID, address, cost, square footage, year built]
#   house_id        - stores unique identifier for each house inputted by user
#   address         - stores address of the house inputted by user
#   cost            - stores cost of the house in dollars inputted by user
#   square_footage  - stores square footage of the house inputted by user
#   year_built      - stores the year the house was built inputted by user
#   num             - stores menu option selected by user to navigate program (1-5)
#   confirm         - stores user confirmation (yes/no) when deleting a house
#   data            - stores a line from the file that is read
#   database        - stores all of the content of the file that is read/written to
#   found           - stores True or False if house is found in the findhouse() function
#   total           - stores the total inventory in the showtotal() function
#   item            - stores every seperated element/item in the list (from the file) as it is converted into a string
#   option          - stores 1 for House ID# or 2 for Cost as the option in the findhouse() function
